This means in practice, the Project.toml of the project dep contains the dependency to orig. First, one should fork the package dep and checkout a new feature branch on this fork. The fix of the integration issue for dep is now developed on the feature branch. Once finished, the changes to dep are push to GitHub, and a pull request on dep is opened to check in the changes. By default, the unit test for dep should fail, because the CI in dep needs to use the modified version of orig. The solution for this problem is explained in the section Unit Test for CI Users. Using this, one should develop the fix on the feature branch until the CI of dep passes all unit tests. In this case, the original pull request in the upstream package orig can be resumed. Therefore, one needs to tell the CI of orig that the integration tests should use the fixed version package dep, which is still on the feature branch in a pull request on dep. In order to proceed, the CI on orig needs information on where the fix for dep is located.
