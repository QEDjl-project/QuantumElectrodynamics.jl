"""
The script checks the dependencies of the current project and provides a Julia environment that
provides all current development versions of the QED dependencies.

The following steps are carried out
1. Create a dependency graph of the active project without instantiating it. The QED
project is cloned to do this, and the current dev branch is used.
2. Calculate the correct order for all QED packages in which the packages must be added to the
environment so that no QED package is added as an implicit dependency.
3. Calculate which packages must be added in which order for the QED package to be tested.
4. Remove all QED packages from the current environment to prevent QED packages defined as
implicit dependencies from being instantiated.
5. Install the QED package for testing and all QED dependencies in the correct order. If it is a
dependency, the compat entry is also changed to match the QED package under test.

The script must be executed in the project space, which should be modified.

QuantumElectrodynamics.jl `Project.toml`, clones all directly and indirectly dependent QED.jl
GitHub repositories and constructs the dependency graph.

- `repository_base_path::AbstractString`: Base folder into which the QED projects are to be cloned.

    `https://github.com/QEDjl-project/<package name>.jl` is used for the clone and the dev branch
    is checked out. The dict allows the use of custom URLs and branches for each QED project. The
    key is the package name and the value must have the following form: `<git_url>#<branch_name>`.
